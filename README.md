## Security Measures

Our application employs dual-layer encryption for your client token using DXAPI and AES. The encrypted token is securely stored in the `%localappdata%/SlashCommandsGUITool/database.db` file. This ensures that even if someone gains unauthorized access to your local database file, they cannot retrieve or decrypt your token. 
We take your security and privacy seriously and are committed to protecting your sensitive information.

## Notices
If you switch the command to the other side without saving (such as switching from Bot to Local), some problems may occur. It is recommended to switch after saving.
